### Day 14 (18/11): LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN
-- Topics: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, including unmatched records

### Practice Questions:
-- 1. Show all staff members and their schedule information (including those with no schedule entries).
SELECT s.staff_id,s.staff_name,s.role,s.service,ss.week,ss.present
FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id ORDER BY s.staff_id, ss.week;

-- 2. List all services from services_weekly and their corresponding staff (show services even if no staff assigned).
SELECT sw.week,sw.month,sw.service,s.staff_id,s.staff_name,s.role
FROM services_weekly sw
LEFT JOIN staff s ON sw.service = s.service ORDER BY sw.service, sw.week;

-- 3. Display all patients and their service's weekly statistics (if available).
SELECT p.patient_id,p.name AS patient_name,p.service,sw.week,sw.month,sw.patients_request,sw.patients_admitted,
sw.patients_refused,sw.patient_satisfaction
FROM patients p LEFT JOIN services_weekly sw ON p.service = sw.service
ORDER BY p.patient_id, sw.week;

/* Day 14(18/11) Challenge:

and the count of weeks they were present (from staff_schedule). Include staff members even if they have no schedule records. 
Order by weeks present descending.*/

SELECT s.staff_id,s.staff_name,s.role,s.service,
    COUNT(ss.present) AS weeks_present FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss
    ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id
GROUP BY s.staff_id,s.staff_name,s.role,s.service
ORDER BY weeks_present DESC,s.staff_name ASC;
